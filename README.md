# MindGuard – Early Stress Detection for Students

MindGuard is an AI-powered prototype designed to **detect academic stress at an early stage** using natural language processing and contextual signals.  
Instead of reacting after burnout, MindGuard focuses on **preventive awareness and guidance**.

This project is built as part of **Hack for Tomorrow – 2026 (Software Edition)** under the **AI & Deep Learning** theme.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Academic pressure silently builds up among students and affects focus, sleep, and productivity.  
Most students realize they are stressed only when it is already too late.

Existing solutions are largely reactive and intervene **after burnout**.  
MindGuard aims to **detect stress early** and provide timely, actionable guidance.

## 💡 Solution Overview

MindGuard analyzes:
- **Student-written reflections** (text input)
- **Basic contextual information** (sleep duration, screen time, deadlines)

Using a hybrid AI approach:
- Deep Learning (NLP) to understand emotional patterns in text
- Rule-based logic to incorporate real-life context

The system outputs:
- Stress Level: **Low / Moderate / High**
- Simple preventive suggestions
